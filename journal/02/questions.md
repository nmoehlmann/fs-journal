06. Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:

    > let x = 1
    > let y = 2

    if (x == y){
        console.log('x is equal to y')

    basically, if a function is given a parameter, it cannot be invoked until the function is given the proper argument that meats the requirements of the parameter.
