# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > We use Git to create repositories for directories and files. We can create local and remote repositories. Local repositories are saved on the computer. Remote repositories are connected to the internet and can be accessed through sites like Github. 

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > It is used to make a new directory

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > A pseudo-class is something you put at the end of a css selector. It targets the element being selected and modifies it.

    >The most common ones I would use are :hover, :link, :visited, and :active.

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > Specificity is what kind of priority a selector has. If an H1 tag is selected in css, and on a different line the H1 tag is selected with a class; The selector with the class selector will be prioritized. Whichever selector is more specific will be prioritized.

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > using the `!important` feature on too many elements will make it near impossible to override using specificity.

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```

    > The selector, property, and value.

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > Good design will make people more engaged with website and its contents. Accessibility allows people to use your website without confusion and shows good web design. simplicity and easy to read sites are a better user experience.

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > Wireframing is important because it allows us to create the outline of a site. It is easy to get overwhelmed when trying to do everything at once, especially when something inevitably goes wrong.

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > They are worth the effort. Wireframing can help get a base outline of the site and is a great way to start. If I were to skip this first step, i would most likely end up spending more time and energy trying to fix or adjust things that could have been easily prevented using the wireframe technique.

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > the flex property gives your container something called a flex context. This allows you to move them around using justify-content and align-items along the x and y axis.

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > margin and padding both affect the box model.
