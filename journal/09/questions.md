# Working in a Professional Environment
01. What is Inheritance?

> | Inheritance is the how classes get data from other classes. For example data that is being inherited from the AppState can be manipulated in a class in a separate file. |

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> | The singleton design pattern uses a class with a single instance of an object. The instance of this object is then used by other classes. This is good for static data. |

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> | The observer pattern is used in a one to many relationship between objects. A publisher class has an array of subscribers in which subscriber classes can subscribe to. The observer attaches and detaches methods to the subscriber class.  |

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> | The strategy pattern isolates classes that have different responsibilities. This helps create an app that is expandable and doesn't get bloated easily. |

05. What is the `Factory` design pattern?

> | the factory pattern is used when an app uses similar functionality for more than one class. It utilizes separate models and will use an instance of the model it needs for the same function. |

06. What is test driven development?

> | Any changes that are made to an app are tested throughout the entire development. You start by adding a list of tests and then passing code through them from the very start. This helps debug issues as they come. |

07. In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

> | DoD is a collective of verifiable and demonstrable milestones and benchmarks met while an app is in development or finished. |

08. Give two examples of a user story:

> | Example for my groups capstone app: When I discarded food from my pantry it showed up on my grocery list. I was confused as to why deleting a food wouldnt just delete it entirely.

This user story could be used as feedback to roll back and change what the discard button does. We could also try and make it more known to the user that "discarding a food in the pantry simply adds it to the grocery list so you have a history and reference for what you want to buy again."

Example for youtube app: While I scrolled through videos, I realized that nothing of my interest was popping up. There is no preference content that I can change in my account settings.

Youtube could possibly add a way to change what videos are recommended to the user by letting the them manually change it in a preferences page. This probably already exists, but this is just an example.  |

09. During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?

> | The ceremony is called Sprint planning. |

10. In which of these ceremonies are Tasks assigned to you?

> | The daily stand-up ceremony is when everyone explains what task they are going to work on for the day.  |
