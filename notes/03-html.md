# HTML

## Head
Favicon can be used to create an icon next to the URL.

## Body
Most websites are made up of a header, main, and footer.

'<main>' blocks can be separated into '<sections>'.
Overusing '<div>' tags can be confusing!

its good practice to use semantic elements instead of over utilizing h1, p, and div tags.
