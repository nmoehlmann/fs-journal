# Git


git actions

## yml file:

adds commands requird to install dependencies

It creates the ssh key

scp saves a file from one application to another over the internet.

It restarts server.

Github wont know what the ip address is or the ssh key it. We need to add repository secret.

in the file its going to use string interpolation so you put the name without the dollar sign. You then copy paste the pem file perfectly. nothing can be modified. It is very sensitive.

# note the entire git action file is public so putting sensitive data in their like the server os is a no no.

# note chmod sets the permissions of the file. the code is determined by what kind of access it gives.

We can add a bucket to the server so that users can upload files.
